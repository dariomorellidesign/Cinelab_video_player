## Development guidelines

- Keep Windows x64 / D3D12 behavior working.
- Build with Visual Studio 2022 and keep `/W4` output clean when possible.
- Do not commit NVIDIA SDK checkouts, FFmpeg binaries, ReShade binaries, experimental DLSS 5 DLLs or other third-party runtime packages.
- Keep temporal-resource state transitions explicit and documented.
- Avoid adding a per-frame `WaitGPU()` to the normal playback path.
- When changing seek/audio lifetime code, test repeated forward/backward seeking.
- When changing UI strings, add English defaults and update the Portuguese pack when practical.
